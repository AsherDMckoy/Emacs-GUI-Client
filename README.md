# Emacs-GUI-Client
A custom gui client for emacs to use modern animations and graphics rendering. I really just want the jelly cursor but don't want to use neovide as I prefer emacs performance, ironically enough I do use Doom Emacs so it's no emacs vs vim I just want some pretty graphics. I couldn't get holo-layer to work so might as well give it a try.
